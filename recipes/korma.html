    <h1>Chicken Korma</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My chicken korma recipe is derived from classic ingredients and spices from India, with chicken marinated in a homemade korma paste and yogurt, then cooked quickly and simmered with cream. Mild in heat, but big on flavor, it's a spicy food lover's dream.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds boneless chicken breast (or chicken thighs), chopped into bite sized pieces</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Chicken Korma:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2-3 spicy chili peppers (I use serrano peppers though you can use other peppers to your preference)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup chicken stock (or more as needed, to simmer)</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream (or use coconut milk)</li>
        <li>FOR SERVING: fresh chopped herbs, spicy red chili flakes, and cashews</li>
    </ul>

       <h4>Steps:</h4>
       <ol>
           <li>
            Making The Korma Paste<br>
            Add the cashew nuts to a food processor and pulse to break them up. Add the tomato paste, garlic, ginger, and seasonings. Add salt and pepper to taste and pulse to form a thick paste. If it is too thick, add a couple tablespoons of water to thin it just slightly. Next, Mix the paste in a small bowl with the yogurt. It gets nice and wet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, spoon the korma sauce over the chopped chicken and mix well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour to marinate and let the flavors develop. You can leave it overnight to develop even more flavor.
            </li>
            <li>Cooking The Chicken Korma <br>
                When you’re ready to cook, heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat.
            </li>
                <li>
                    Add the onion and cook with the peppers. Cook them down for 5 minutes to soften.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the chicken and cook with all of the marinade (Korma sauce) along with the chicken stock. Stir and cook for 15 minutes, stirring here and there.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir in the heavy cream or coconut milk and simmer for 10 more minutes. Do not let it boil. You can simmer longer if you’d like to let the flavors develop more. I usually let it simmer for a good 20 minutes or longer for more flavor.
                </li>
       </ol>
