        <b>Crema:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large avocados, halved</li>
            <li>1/4-1/2 cup pickled jalapeños</li>
            <li>1/2 cup fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1-2 teaspoons honey</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, grated</li>
            <li>2 limes (juice from)</li>
            <li>flaky salt</li>
        </ul>
    

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

   
    <ol>
        <strong>Crockpot</strong>
        <li>In the bowl of your crockpot, combine the chicken, onion, enchilada sauce, chipotle, oregano, cumin, and salt. Cover and cook on LOW for 4-5 hours or on HIGH for 2-3 hours.</li>

        <li>When finished cooking, shred the meat and toss with the sauce. Preheat the oven to 425° F.</li>

        <li>Warm the tortillas for 30 seconds to 1 minute in the microwave, until pliable. On a baking sheet, rub the tortillas with olive oil. Lay each tortilla flat and then layer evenly with cheese and chicken. Fold the other half of the tortilla over the filling, gently pushing to adhere (see above photo). Transfer to the oven and bake for 5-8 minutes, then flip and cook another 5 minutes, or until the cheese has melted and the tortillas are crisp. </li>

        <li>Meanwhile, make the Avocado Crema. Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth and creamy. Season with salt.</li>

        <li>Serve the tacos topped with avocado, lettuce, limes, and any other desired toppings.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        <strong>Instant Pot</strong>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 425° F.</li>

        <li>In the bowl of your instant pot, combine the chicken, onion, enchilada sauce, chipotle, oregano, cumin, and salt. Seal the lid and cook on high pressure for 8 minutes. Once done cooking, release the steam. 
        <li>Follow the directions as directed above for steps 2-5.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        <strong>Stove-top</strong>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 425° F.</li>

        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. When the oil shimmers, add the chicken. Cook until 2-3 minutes, then flip and add the onion. Cook another 3-5 minutes, until fragrant. Add the enchilada sauce, chipotle, oregano, cumin, and salt, and 1/3 cup water. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the sauce has thickened and the chicken cooked through, about 10-15 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>

        <li>Warm the tortillas for 30 seconds to 1 minute in the microwave, until pliable. On a baking sheet, rub the tortillas with olive oil. Lay each flat and then layer evenly with cheese and chicken. Fold the other half of the tortilla over the filling, gently pushing to adhere (see above photo). Transfer to the oven and bake for 5-8 minutes, then flip and cook another 5 minutes more, or until the cheese has melted and the tortillas are crisp. </li>

        <li>Meanwhile, make the Avocado Crema. Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth and creamy. Season with salt.</li>

        <li>Serve the tacos topped with avocado, lettuce, limes, and any other desired toppings.
