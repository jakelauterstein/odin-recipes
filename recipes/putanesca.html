    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The one-pot pasta method works beautifully here: As the pasta cooks, the juicy tomatoes break down and mingle with the briny olives and capers to create a salty, starchy sauce that clings to the noodles. You can use any long pasta shape you like as long as it cooks to al dente in nine to 10 minutes (I always opt for linguine).</p>
